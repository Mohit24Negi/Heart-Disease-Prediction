# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project builds a machine learning model to predict heart disease using clinical and demographic data. It includes data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and model evaluation. Boosting models like LightGBM and CatBoost achieve high ROC-AUC and recall, supporting early and accurate medical risk detection.
